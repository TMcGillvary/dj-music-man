# DJ Music Man

A Discord bot built using the example code from [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js).

The example code provided in discord.js@voice is currently outdated for the latest dependencies. I tried to update the code to be compliant with the latest versions, but I believe it has caused some bugs.

Known bugs include the 3 Second Song Skip Bug.

However, for being a weekend project (and first time using Typescript) it's not half-bad, if I do say so myself!

## Usage

```bash
# Clone the main repository, and then run:
$ npm install

# Set a bot token
$ nano auth.json

# Start the bot!
$ npm start
```
